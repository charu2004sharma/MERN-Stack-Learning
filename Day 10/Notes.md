 Combining Variables, Loops, and Functions  

 *1. How They Work Together*  
- *Variables:* Store and pass data within loops and functions.  
- *Loops:* Execute repetitive tasks efficiently.  
- *Functions:* Encapsulate logic for reusability and clarity.  

*2. Examples*  
1. Factorial of a Number.
2. Check Even or Odd.
3. Fibonacci Series.
 
Reflection
	•	Combining these concepts made solving problems easier and more systematic.
	•	Writing reusable functions for common patterns like Fibonacci improved my understanding of logic design.

Looking Forward:
Next, I’ll tackle more complex problems and practice using these skills to write optimized solutions.
