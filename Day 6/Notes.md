# Networking Basics: Comprehensive Notes  
This document summarizes key topics in networking, including HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, and browser-server communication.  

 *1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)*  
- Protocol for transferring data between browsers and servers.  
- *HTTP Methods:* GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.  
- *Status Codes:*  
  - *2xx:* Success (e.g., 200 OK).  
  - *4xx:* Client errors (e.g., 404 Not Found).  
  - *5xx:* Server errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).  

 *2. HTTPS (HTTP Secure)*  
- Secure version of HTTP using SSL/TLS encryption.  
- *Benefits:*  
  - Data confidentiality and integrity.  
  - Authentication via SSL certificates.  
  - SEO boost and user trust (padlock icon).  

 *3. DNS (Domain Name System)*  
- Resolves domain names into IP addresses.  
- *Key Records:*  
  - *A Record:* Maps to IPv4 address.  
  - *CNAME Record:* Alias for another domain.  
  - *MX Record:* Mail server details.  

*4. Browser-Server Communication*  
- *Request-Response Cycle:*  
  - Browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server.  
  - Server responds with a status code, headers, and body.  
- Tools like Chrome DevTools help analyze headers, requests, and responses.  

*5. Caching and Sessions*  
- *Caching:* Improves performance by storing copies of resources.  
  - *Cache-Control Headers:* Manage caching policies.  
- *Sessions:* Server-side storage to maintain user state, often used with cookies.
