# Day 1: HTTP and HTTPS Basics

*HTTP Basics*
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web.
- *HTTP Methods:*
  - GET: Retrieve data from a server.
  - POST: Send data to a server for processing.
  - PUT: Update data on a server.
  - DELETE: Remove data from a server.
- *HTTP Status Codes:*
  - 200: Success
  - 404: Not Found
  - 500: Internal Server Error

*HTTPS Basics*
- HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is HTTP with encryption using SSL/TLS.
- It ensures:
  - *Confidentiality*: Data is encrypted and cannot be intercepted.
  - *Integrity*: Data is not altered during transmission.
  - *Authentication*: Ensures the server is legitimate through SSL certificates.
- Example of HTTPS in action:
  - A padlock icon in the browser indicates a secure connection.
  
*Key Differences Between HTTP and HTTPS*

|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Encryption      | No            | Yes (via SSL/TLS) |
| URL Prefix      | http://       | https://          |
