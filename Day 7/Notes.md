# Day 7

 *1. Variables*  
- Variables store data that can be used and manipulated in a program.  
- In many programming languages, variables are declared with specific syntax.  
 
*2. Data Types*  
- Common data types include:  
  - *Integer:* Whole numbers (e.g., 42, 100).  
  - *String:* Text data enclosed in quotes (e.g., "Hello, World!").  
  - *Boolean:* Logical values (True, False).  

  3. Basic Operations
	•	Variables support operations like addition, subtraction, and concatenation.
	•	Example (Adding Numbers):

let a = 5, b = 7;
console.log(a + b); // Output: 12

Reflection
	•	Variables are fundamental to storing and manipulating data in programs.
	•	Practicing basic operations helped reinforce these concepts.
