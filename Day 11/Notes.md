## Day 11: Problem-Solving Practice  

*1. Problem-Solving with Variables, Loops, and Functions*  
- Practiced solving practical problems using variables, loops, and functions.  
- Focused on breaking problems into smaller steps to write cleaner and more efficient code.  

*2. Problems Solved*  

1. *Sum of an Array*  
   - Added all numbers in a list using a loop.
     
2. *Find the Smallest Number*  
   - Used a loop to find the smallest number in an array.  

3. *Check Palindrome*  
   - Wrote a function to check if a string is a palindrome.  
     
*Reflection*  
- Solving problems step by step improved my debugging and logical thinking.  
- Working on examples like palindromes and array operations made loops and functions feel intuitive.
